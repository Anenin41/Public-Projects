\begin{abstract}
	This report studies the computational comparisons of the most famous numerical heuristic schemes (NN, GA, SA, ACO) that solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). First, this discrete optimization problem is introduced, alongside some required simplifications. Then, the basic idea of each heuristic scheme is described, with the goal to establish a difficulty baseline between these algorithms. Lastly, these methods are put to the test for 30 randomly generated case studies of graphs with 229 cities, which is equivalent in essence as trying to solve the real-world problem for the Netherlands. The results favour the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) heuristic scheme, and showcase that complexity of ideas doesn't necessarily translate to better results.
