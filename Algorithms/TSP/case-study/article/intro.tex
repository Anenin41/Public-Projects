\section{Introduction}
\label{sec: intro}

In a world increasingly shaped by complex and multi-variable problems, the ability to model, analyse, and optimize systems in now more critical than ever. Mathematics in combination with the natural sciences have helped us understand the world around us to an astonishing extent, from harnessing the power of atoms, to producing machines that can automate almost any task.

As our daily life shifts more and more towards a digital world, and our spirits class with new extraordinary problems, we have found new ways to express our intuition in problem-solving through computational experiments. By bits and bytes, we are able to produce results in even the most complex of theories, from particle simulations drawn from the Kinetic Theory of Gases \cite{pareschi2001introduction}, to Quantum Mechanics \cite{miceli2018quantum}.

There are many cases, however, where even our best machines are not enough to help us solve a problem. This report showcases one such problematic case, called the \textbf{Travelling Salesman Problem}, which pushes to the limits both Mathematics and Computer Science. In instances such as these, we rely on approximate solutions to produce something tangible that we can later use to achieve our goals.
