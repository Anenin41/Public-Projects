# Personal Projects Repository
This repository lists polished projects that I have completed, both during my studies and in my free time. A plethora of different projects can be found here, from Applied Mathematics reports, to computational simulations and to fun little projects that I have embarked on during the years.

## Moments
This folder contains the base files for the *Enhancing Black-Scholes Option Pricing: A Method of Moments Approach* report. The first draft of this work was done under the course of Model Reduction for Partial Differential Equations at the University of Groningen. Following the success that it had on the course, it was then slightly modified and polished to the form that it is today.

## Algorithms
This folder contains all of the relevant files of the mathematical field of *Algorithms & Optimization*. In here, the main file of the Beamer presentation on the subject of the *Travelling Salesman Problem* can be found, my topic of choice for the final presentation of the course *Iterative Algorithms* at the University of Groningen. Moreover, the source files for the final report on the course of Mathematics & Environment are also present, a case study in which famous heuristic algorithms are compared in the Symmetric TSP.

## Fluids
This folder contains everything that is relevant to the field of *Computational Fluid Dynamics*. In here, a Finite-Elements simulation of the stabilized **Navier-Stokes** equation can be found, an experiment that was run under the *Finite Element Methods & Applications* course in the University of Groningen. 

In addition, various Finite-Difference methods are listed as well, also from my studies in the University of Groningen, but under the course of *Computational Fluid Dynamics*. These applications are coded in different programming languages, to showcase versatily. A short GIF showcasing the bloodflow experiment can be seen below[^1].

## Julia
The Julia folder stands for projects that I have completed in the Julia Programming Language, but do not fit in the umbrella folders that are described above. The majority of them are personal projects, but since Julia is fast, an attempt is currently made to transfer code from other languages to this one for benchmarking purposes.

## Python
This folder lists short and long projects that I have completed in Python. Since this is a versatile language, many items are listed here, from quality of life pieces of code, to projects that I have implemented outside of academia.
